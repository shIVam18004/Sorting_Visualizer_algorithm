# 🎨 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive and educational **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
This project allows users to visually observe how different sorting algorithms work in real-time with adjustable speed and data customization.

## 🧩 Elements and Structure

- **Python (Tkinter GUI)**  
  - GUI components like buttons, labels, canvas for drawing.
  - Sliders for size, minimum value, maximum value, and speed control.

- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  - Bubble Sort (Simple comparison-based sorting)
  - Merge Sort (Divide and conquer-based efficient sorting)
  - Quick Sort (Partition-based fast sorting)

- **Visualization Logic**  
  - Dynamically updating the canvas to reflect each step of sorting.
  - Bars color changes (current operation highlighted).
